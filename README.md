# 🚀 Welcome to Ina's Lab 👩‍💻

*Where bugs fear to tread and coffee is the fuel of choice*

## 👩‍💻 Who Am I?

Hi, I'm Ina! By day, I wrangle code into submission. By night... I also wrangle code into submission, but with more snacks and questionable music choices.

## 🧠 Code Philosophy

```javascript
if (coffee.isEmpty()) {
  developer.functionality = null;
  developer.humor = "grumpy";
  coffee.refill();
}
```

## 🛠️ What Happens Here

This is my digital playground where:

- Code is written, deleted, rewritten, and occasionally framed
- Bugs come to meet their maker
- Impossible deadlines suddenly become... slightly less impossible
- Stack Overflow is my spiritual guide

## 🔥 House Rules

1. **Commit messages must be comprehensible** to future me who will have forgotten everything about this code
2. **Tabs vs Spaces**: Choose wisely, for your preference shall be judged silently
3. **Naming variables after Star Trek characters** is perfectly acceptable in test environments
4. **The answer is usually on Stack Overflow**, but pretend you figured it out yourself

## 💡 When In Doubt

```
git commit -m "It works! Don't touch it!"
git push
```

## 📊 Productivity Metrics

- Cups of Coffee Consumed: ∞
- Bugs Squashed: Many
- Bugs Created: Let's not talk about that
- Stack Overflow Visits: "It's over 9000!"

## 📫 Need Me?

I'm probably debugging something that "worked perfectly yesterday." Try turning it off and on again before contacting me.
